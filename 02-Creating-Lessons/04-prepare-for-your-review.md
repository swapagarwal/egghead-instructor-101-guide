# Our Expectations of Your Lesson
What you leave out is often more important than what you include in an egghead lesson. We've reviewed hundreds
of lessons and we've seen many patterns emerge. We continually refine our guidelines as we learn.
Please watch the [Record Badass Screencasts for egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/record-badass-screencasts-for-egghead-io) course before you begin making lessons to help smooth out the review process and set proper expectations:

The most common issues are the following:


## ** Avoid Intros and Outros **

The most common review feeback is: "Cut out the intro". Generally speaking, people are going to watch more than one lesson. Greeting them and wishing them farewell is not adding anything to their experience.

Please don't greet the student, introduce yourself, talk about past lessons, talk about future lessons, plug your podcast, or anything that isn't core to the lesson.

Just start doing. Start showing. You can recap the lesson at the end if you like, but keep it short and just nail the key points and then just stop! Make them yearn for more.

## ** Stay on Topic **

Now. Stay in it.

As much as possible try to avoid referencing other lessons. "In the next lesson..." or "In the previous lesson..." should be avoided. An egghead.io lesson should be as self-contained as possible, teaching a concept. The lesson will be surrounded by context in the form of a list of related lessons, a title, a text description with helpful links.

If you do need to reference a prerequisite lesson, link to it in the description!

## Guide Their Eyes

Your audience is trying to follow what you're saying. Always remember there is someone watching
this lesson who has never watched it before. They don't know what you're thinking or what you're going
to do next, so it's crucial that you keep them with you by guiding their eyes. Guide their eyes by
highlighting the area of the screen that you're teaching. Use the mouse to select/click/drag or anything
that creates a sense of movement to tell them "You should be looking here!" Remember, this is a video,
they're here for the _movement_, so keep it movin'!
